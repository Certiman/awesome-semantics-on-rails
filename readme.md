## Ontologies

### Ontology Implementations

* [ERA Ontology](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/) - ERA ontology covering topology, railway infrastructure and vehicle types. The namespace URI for the ontology is `http://data.europa.eu/949/`


### Academic Papers

* [Rail Topology Ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04378) - Rail Topology Ontology: A Rail Infrastructure Base Ontology.
* 


## Knowledge Graphs

### Sparql Endpoints

* [ERA Endpoint](https://virtuoso.ecdp.tech.ec.europa.eu/sparql) - Sparql Endpoint of the European Union Agency for Railways containing more than 50 million triples of railway infrastructure and vehicle types. 


### Semantic Network

* [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io/) - ConceptNet is a freely-available semantic network, designed to help computers understand the meanings of words that people use.
* [Microsoft Concept Graph](https://concept.research.microsoft.com/) - For Short Text Understanding
* [OpenHowNet](https://openhownet.thunlp.org) - An Open Sememe-based Lexical Knowledge Base in Chinese.
* [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) - A free large lexical database of English from Princeton University.



## Applications

### Generic Applications

* [Search](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/search) - Searching form of resources in the ERA endpoint.
* [Map Explorer](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/map-explorer) - Visualizing EU railway infrastructure.
* [Route Compatibility Check](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/route-compatibility) - Route compatibility check of vehicle types against railway infrastructure.


### Community Effort


## Conferences

### Railways conferences

* [Rail Data Forum](https://www.era.europa.eu/content/rail-data-forum-2024) - powered by European Union Agency for Railways
* [RailML Conference](hhttps://www.railml.org/en/public-relations/news/reader/44th-railml-conference.html) - RailML conference
* [SEMIC](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semic-support-centre/semic-conference) - EU SEMIC conference
